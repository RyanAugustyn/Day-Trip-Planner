# Day-Trip-Planner

First devCodeCamp project: 

'Day Trip Planner' that randomly generates one item from four categories (destination, restaurant, transportation, and activity/entertainment) and 
presents it to the user. The user would then have the option to randomly regenrate by picking from any of the four categories (with a check to ensure same item isn't randomly chosen 
again), an option to randomly regenerate everything, and an option to randomly pick on of those choices. Once satisfied, the list is reprinted to the console. 


(5 points): Single Responsibility: As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do just one thing!
